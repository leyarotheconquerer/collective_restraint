# Theme: Stuck in a Loop

Game which is the same thing over and over
You just modify it


Game in which you are inside a geometric loop

Game in which you expand a loop of levels
By choosing which ability you want at the end of the level
Chosen ability influences which room is added to level
Score increases with each run?
Time tracked and looped somehow?

Game where you must capture all the aliens and trap them in a loop

Game where you must capture a monster by surrounding it with a loop
Monster will try to escape
Monster is larger than you?
Monster is faster than you?
Terrain is restrictive (to you)?
Danger: Content hog
Danger: AI

Game where you must expand a loop in which you are trapped
Or game where the loop around you gets smaller
Like most battle royale
Expand the loop by collecting things
Navigate inside the loop using movement and jumps?
Around obstacles?
Make the loop a sphere?

Hey! Spherical asteroids?
Sphere shrinks over time?
