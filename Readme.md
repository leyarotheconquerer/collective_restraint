# Theme: Stuck in a Loop

Game which is the same thing over and over
You just modify it


Game in which you are inside a geometric loop

Game in which you expand a loop of levels
By choosing which ability you want at the end of the level
Chosen ability influences which room is added to level
Score increases with each run?
Time tracked and looped somehow?
Abilities include:
* Moving forward
* Moving sideways
* Turning
* Pressing blue buttons
* Pressing red buttons
* Picking up blue blocks
* Picking up red blocks
* Jumping
* Grappling?
Each room has multiple ways to complete it
Prefer to make it easier to finish levels by abilities unlocked later on
"Loop to Freedom"

## The Duck Option
Add a duck
Over time increase the numer of ducks
Add an ability asking, "what's with the ducks?"
Response is to start over, with a dialog like:
* "What ducks?"
* "There are no ducks"
* "What even is a duck?"
* "You must just be seeing things"
* "Trust the duck. The duck is your friend"

Game where you must capture all the aliens and trap them in a loop

Game where you must capture a monster by surrounding it with a loop
Monster will try to escape
Monster is larger than you?
Monster is faster than you?
Terrain is restrictive (to you)?
Dangers:
* Content hog
* AI
* Detecting if in loop (dynamic geometry?)
	- Could make this simpler by limiting to three posts
	- Could draw a cylinder using those three points
	- Collide against cylinder
May need monster attractors
Would need to make monster behavior predictable
But difficult
That would be hard to balance
Could add additional enemies which drain your health that you must deal with
More AI would be hard though
Types of monsters:
* Fast
* Large
* Swimming
Types of terrain:
* Open
* Corridor
* Ponded
* Forested
* Hilly
* Mountainy
* Cliff
* Plateau

Game where you must expand a loop in which you are trapped
Expand the loop by collecting things
Bounce around loop?
Jump between platforms in loop?
Time until loop failure?
Time until loop contracts?
Pillars in the sky?
Would work for a platformer, but could we use a different traverse mechanic?
Buttons... meh
Fighting? Could be fun


Jedi in a shield loop
Lots of droids outside the shield
Kill a bunch, shield expands
As shield expands, more are let in
Will try to shoot you
Must go around killing them
As shield expands, you get more abilities or things to collect (like health)
Different droids spawn as shield expands
Basically just a brawler
Dangers:
* AI!!!
* Damage model
* Fun combat
* Different attacks (content)


Or game where the loop around you gets smaller
Like most battle royale
Navigate inside the loop using movement and jumps?
Around obstacles?
Make the loop a sphere?

Hey! Spherical asteroids?
Sphere shrinks over time?
